<p>Back in 2010 when I decided I wanted to be a &#39;web designer&#39; and was learning the basics of HTML and CSS my then-boyfriend-now-husband told me I should check out this blog called Codrops for tutorials. This was before css transitions had entered the mainstream and everyone was animating with jQuery and I remember just being <em>blown away</em> by how awesome their demos and tutorials were. I have been using them as an inspiration source ever since then. </p>
<p>So you can imagine my shock and delight when Manoela Ilic (you may know her as Mary Lou) contacted me earlier this year about the possibility of contributing to Codrops. I had to pinch myself!</p>
<p>Well it took me a while to get my butt in to gear and finish the demos as I was working all summer on <a href="http://spacecraftforall.com">Spacecraft For All</a>, <a href="http://gisele.underarmour.com">Gisele BÃ¼ndchen for Under Armour</a> and <a href="http://witnessgotham.com">Witness Gotham</a> with Active Theory. But today it was finally published and I am really, really, excited about it.</p>
<p>My personal history with Codrops aside, the fact that my work has been published alongside articles by <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/author/crnacura/">Manoela Ilic</a> and <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/author/sarasoueidan/">Sara Soueidan</a> is very flattering as I have admired these talented and creative women for a while now.</p>
<p>Alright, that is it from me, <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/09/23/animated-background-headers/">go check out the article!</a></p>

    <p>If you're a fellow designer or dev with a question for me I'd love you to submit it over at my <a href="https://github.com/rachsmithcodes/ama">Github AMA</a>.</p>
    <p>Please note I am not looking for a new job and am not taking on any freelance work at this time so emailing me about that would just be a waste of your time :)</p>
