<p>Earlier this year, Dan Denney asked if I would like to speak at this year&#39;s <a href="http://frontenddesignconference.com/">Front End Design Conference</a> in St Petersburg, Florida. Being fairly new to the USA I jumped at the chance to share and connect with the Front End community in this fine country.</p>
<p>I had read plenty of great things about the conference but Andy and I could never have imagined we&#39;d have such an amazing weekend in St Pete and meet <em>so many</em> awesome people.</p>
<p>On our first night in St Pete we met the other speakers, and once I got to know this intelligent &amp; tallented yet exremely genuine group of people, I felt truly flattered that Dan considered me worthy to present along side them. The content over the weekend was top notch and I really walked away newly inspired to expand my front end horizons.</p>
<p>One of my favourite things about Front End Conf was the diversity (gender and ethnicity) in the speakers and audience. In fact there were <em>so many</em> women that it was the first dev meetup where I actually didn&#39;t feel like I stood out at all. The whole weekend my gender was not even mentioned once in conversation which was crazy refreshing. That might seem like a weird thing to comment on but it was just so good when I am used to being stared at or constantly asked questions along the lines of &quot;so how does it feel to be the only woman at your work&quot; instead of questions about my actual work.</p>

<p>On the whole, the people and the atmostphere at this conference was nothing short of wonderful for Andy and myself. I don&#39;t think this was any happy accident. Over the weekend I also got to know Dan and Cherrie a little better and it became clear to me that everything good about Front End Design conf stems from these two incredible people. I truly feel blessed that Dan stumbled across me on internet one day as his friendship has had such a positive impact on my life already.</p>
<p>To conclude, I have to say if you are able to, <a href="http://frontenddesignconference.com/portland">you should TOTALLY join us for the Portland Front End Conf</a>. Can&#39;t wait to see you there.</p>
