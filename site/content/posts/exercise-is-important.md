# Exercise is important, duh

Lately I've been feeling in a bit of a rut creatively. I've just felt so blah and only have the mental energy to get my day job done, let alone any side projects. Over the past week I've been doing some soul searching to try and figure out what is bothering me. Is it work? Am I drinking too much? Should I stop obsessively playing Family Guy Quest For Stuff on my iPhone?

I haven't been to the gym since early December. I went this morning and as I was struggling away on the rowing machine it hit me (along with a flood of creative inspiration, motivation and ideas). I hadn't exercised and it was getting to me! Duh!

Aside from the flow of endorphins a workout session creates, when I really think about it I realise that gym time is the only time in the week where I am 'alone' and not staring at a screen. I either spend time socializing (out with friends, date night with my husband) or I'm spending 'me time' staring at a screen (phone,computer,tv,kindle). Even when I'm cooking I will watch the TV from our kitchen. At the gym it is just me and the exercise and my thoughts. If I go a month without the exercise my brain starts to fall apart.  

I do this (don't go to the gym for weeks, fall in a 'rut', wonder what the hell is wrong because I've forgotten about the exercise thing) maybe three times a year. Hopefully my writing this here will help make 2015 the year I don't skip going to the gym for extended periods. I realise that is the most generic 'year goal' of all time but whatever.
