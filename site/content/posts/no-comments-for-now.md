# No comments for now

Getting a new build of the site up, I was questioning whether to include Disqus comments in this version. I decided against it.

I decided against comments because my experience thus far with comments on my site have been more negative than positive. Too many people don't even read the post and then write an (often rude) comment about one thing, which I then have to delete (I refuse to let A-holes use my own site as a platform). As a result I found I was reluctant to post anything for fear of getting stupid comments, and my plan for this year was to write more.

Although it did result in some positive engagement with other people, I think I will leave comments off the blog for now, and encourage people to leave feedback via <a href="http://twitter.com/rachsmithtweets">Twitter</a> instead.
