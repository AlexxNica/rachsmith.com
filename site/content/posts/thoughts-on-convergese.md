#Thoughts on Converge SE

Wow I'm actually blogging. This is happening. April has been totally bananas. 2015 has been non-stop for Active Theory and I had a huge site launch for the first weekend of Coachella, followed almost immediately by flying out to South Carolina to debut a new talk for Converge SE. Although everything has gone amazingly well I am now the definition of wrecked. As such I’m not really capable of stringing together a coherent write up but I wanted to get some thoughts down & reflect before life flies on and suddenly it is 6 months later and I’ve forgotten what even happened to me. Heads up: it's basically just going to be a bunch of feels.

One of the things I was most looking forward to about this week was getting to hang out with 3 of my heroes, the CodePen team. They continue to be fabulous and lovely and I relished my ‘once a year’ chance to hang out IRL style with one of my favourite people on this earth, Chris.

The venue for keynotes was super cool and a little bit rock & roll and I totally digged it.

The presentations for Front End track were seriously on point this year and I am actually so glad I went first because I would have hated to follow any of them. That being said I felt good about my preso and probably got the most positive feedback I’ve ever received for speaking. I hope the front-enders enjoyed listening to me cause I really enjoyed giving that talk. 

I love mac & cheese. Like, really love it. But I think I ate so much I broke my stomach & the thought of food made me feel a little ill from day 3 onwards (or maybe the beer had a little something to do with that?).

There were so many exceptionally talented & funny women at Converge I got plenty of ‘girl time’ in which was just the best. It was especially great to meet my #makeupconf internet friends in real life and I really hope I get to see them again soon. I love all y’all ladies!

My favourite Front End track talks would have to have been Geoff Kimball’s *3 Ways to Go Mobile First with Responsive Design*, Mina Markham’s *Modular CSS with Sass*, Megan Zlock’s *A more beautiful, accessible web for all!* and Bryce Bigger’s *Games & Shenanigans with WebGL & Unity*.

It was actually so exciting to meet Bryce because he is in to all of the same web stuff as me (basically the exciting possibilities that JavaScript in the browser creates) and he’s also been doing this stuff for way longer than me. I enjoyed picking his brain about working for himself and his business and past experiences. Dude has creativity and cleverness out the wazoo.

I am pretty grateful that no one periscoped my totally inappropriate song choice of Pony by Ginuine at karaoke. We live in dangerous times.

Speaking of karaoke, this happened. It was a truly special moment.

I don’t often drink at World of Beer, but when I do, I do it with these guys. I don't often play favourites, but when I do, these two are my favourites. Can you see how bloody happy I am here? I need to take a chill pill.

The keynote presenters I enjoyed the most: Mason Stewart (I may be biased), Steph Hay & Carl Smith. Stephanie Hay... wow, what an amazing accomplished woman to look up to & she had the best presentation style!! I hope that one day I can present even a little bit as well as her - #goals. Carl is just a straight up baller and his talks are always so motivational.

I’d always known Carl Smith as a friendly, funny man with lots of great stories but after getting in to a deep conversation (as people are often to do after several hours of drinks and karaoke) I discovered a kindred spirit who I have about a million things in common with. He has a good soul and I would now call him a dear friend. #smithclub.

Aaron Gustafson actually made me feel a little excited for the "not IE new IE"/Spartan browser to be released so we can try our sites on it! So mad evangelising props to him, I hope Microsoft is paying him the big bucks.

I have seriously never met an employee of the Iron Yard or Sparkbox that isn’t an interesting and super chill person. Pretty sure that’s cause the founders of those companies are amazing & take time to find good people and promote good culture. Those people deserve to enjoy every success in the world. 

One thing I really enjoyed was talking to backend/Ops peeps about working with the cloud etc. I’ve been doing a lot of backend & Ops work for AT recently and because I’ve mostly been the only one doing it it can get a little isolating. It was so good to be able to talk to folks who understood my frustrations and could help me out with things. It made me realise that I really do enjoy doing a bit of backend work (on the days things work) and I 100% agree with Mason’s talk encouraging front-enders to try other parts of the stack because doing that has made me very happy. Coding for the browser will always be my first and true love though!!!

James if you’re reading this I’m sorry I unleashed my Samsung rage on you. Maybe you should upgrade to a Nexus or something ;)

Overall it is pretty clear thus far that although my brain benefits from all the excellent content at this conference it is truly the people (old friends or new acquaintances) I get to talk to that lights up my creative spirit. It's like all of these super intelligent, interesting and creative people recharge my batteries and although I am physically tired as shit, I feel so ready to go out there and apply a new enthusiasm to my day job & other endeavours. I am forever grateful to the Unmatched Style / Converge SE team for allowing me to be a part of this and also for putting on such a well run event. I am going to suffer from post-conf blues for some time this week. x
