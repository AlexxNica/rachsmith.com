#Contributing to Codrops

Back in 2010 when I decided I wanted to be a 'web designer' and was learning the basics of HTML and CSS my then-boyfriend-now-husband told me I should check out this blog called Codrops for tutorials. This was before css transitions had entered the mainstream and everyone was animating with jQuery and I remember just being *blown away* by how awesome their demos and tutorials were. I have been using them as an inspiration source ever since then. 

So you can imagine my shock and delight when Manoela Ilic (you may know her as Mary Lou) contacted me earlier this year about the possibility of contributing to Codrops. I had to pinch myself!

Well it took me a while to get my butt in to gear and finish the demos as I was working all summer on [Spacecraft For All](http://spacecraftforall.com), [Gisele BÃ¼ndchen for Under Armour](http://gisele.underarmour.com) and [Witness Gotham](http://witnessgotham.com) with Active Theory. But today it was finally published and I am really, really, excited about it.

My personal history with Codrops aside, the fact that my work has been published alongside articles by [Manoela Ilic](http://tympanus.net/codrops/author/crnacura/) and [Sara Soueidan](http://tympanus.net/codrops/author/sarasoueidan/) is very flattering as I have admired these talented and creative women for a while now.

Alright, that is it from me, [go check out the article!](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/09/23/animated-background-headers/)
