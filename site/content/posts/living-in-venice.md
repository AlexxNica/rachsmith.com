# Just one of many things I like about living in Venice

I have a little bike that I use to get to and from work. I love it because it is light as a feather and takes up no space in our apartment. However the wheels are very small and as a result there is a lot of peddling going on while getting from A to B, and hills are a nightmare.

Almost every day when I'm riding about I will have multiple strangers yell words of encouragement at me (I guess it looks like riding my bike is hard work). A lot of these people are actually the various homeless people in my neighbourhood but I also get other people yelling things out of their cars at me too. It reminds of my hometown, except instead of the usual unimaginative cat-calling and/or abuse, things like 'keep peddling' or 'you can do it!' are hollered in my direction. It is pretty funny to witness and just one of the many quirks of this particular area.

I guess it is sort of like my own personal reminder to make the most of each day. If the old bloke who spent the night sleeping on the sidewalk and has no breakfast to eat can still call out 'go get it, girl!' to me as I ride past, then maybe I can get over myself and whatever #firstworldproblems are bothering me that day and just go get it.
