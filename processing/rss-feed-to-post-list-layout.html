<h1 id="rss-feed-to-post-list-layout">RSS Feed to Post List Layout</h1>
<p>I wrote some CSS for once :) This pen takes an RSS feed (I&#39;ve used the CodePen picked posts here) and creates a list of links to the post. The layout is inspired by <a href="http://minimalmonkey.com/">http://minimalmonkey.com/</a></p>
