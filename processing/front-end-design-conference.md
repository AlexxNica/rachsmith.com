# Front End Design Conference 2014

Earlier this year, Dan Denney asked if I would like to speak at this year's [Front End Design Conference](http://frontenddesignconference.com/) in St Petersburg, Florida. Being fairly new to the USA I jumped at the chance to share and connect with the Front End community in this fine country.

I had read plenty of great things about the conference but Andy and I could never have imagined we'd have such an amazing weekend in St Pete and meet *so many* awesome people.

On our first night in St Pete we met the other speakers, and once I got to know this intelligent & tallented yet exremely genuine group of people, I felt truly flattered that Dan considered me worthy to present along side them. The content over the weekend was top notch and I really walked away newly inspired to expand my front end horizons.

One of my favourite things about Front End Conf was the diversity (gender and ethnicity) in the speakers and audience. In fact there were *so many* women that it was the first dev meetup where I actually didn't feel like I stood out at all. The whole weekend my gender was not even mentioned once in conversation which was crazy refreshing. That might seem like a weird thing to comment on but it was just so good when I am used to being stared at or constantly asked questions along the lines of "so how does it feel to be the only woman at your work" instead of questions about my actual work.

On the whole, the people and the atmostphere at this conference was nothing short of wonderful for Andy and myself. I don't think this was any happy accident. Over the weekend I also got to know Dan and Cherrie a little better and it became clear to me that everything good about Front End Design conf stems from these two incredible people. I truly feel blessed that Dan stumbled across me on internet one day as his friendship has had such a positive impact on my life already.

To conclude, I have to say if you are able to, [you should TOTALLY join us for the Portland Front End Conf](http://frontenddesignconference.com/portland). Can't wait to see you there.
