<h1 id="exercise-is-important-duh">Exercise is important, duh</h1>
<p>Lately I&#39;ve been feeling in a bit of a rut creatively. I&#39;ve just felt so blah and only have the mental energy to get my day job done, let alone any side projects. Over the past week I&#39;ve been doing some soul searching to try and figure out what is bothering me. Is it work? Am I drinking too much? Should I stop obsessively playing Family Guy Quest For Stuff on my iPhone?</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t been to the gym since early December. I went this morning and as I was struggling away on the rowing machine it hit me (along with a flood of creative inspiration, motivation and ideas). I hadn&#39;t exercised and it was getting to me! Duh!</p>
<p>Aside from the flow of endorphins a workout session creates, when I really think about it I realise that gym time is the only time in the week where I am &#39;alone&#39; and not staring at a screen. I either spend time socializing (out with friends, date night with my husband) or I&#39;m spending &#39;me time&#39; staring at a screen (phone,computer,tv,kindle). Even when I&#39;m cooking I will watch the TV from our kitchen. At the gym it is just me and the exercise and my thoughts. If I go a month without the exercise my brain starts to fall apart.  </p>
<p>I do this (don&#39;t go to the gym for weeks, fall in a &#39;rut&#39;, wonder what the hell is wrong because I&#39;ve forgotten about the exercise thing) maybe three times a year. Hopefully my writing this here will help make 2015 the year I don&#39;t skip going to the gym for extended periods. I realise that is the most generic &#39;year goal&#39; of all time but whatever.</p>
