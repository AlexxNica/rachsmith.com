<h1 id="i-ll-be-presenting-at-space-city-js">I&#39;ll be presenting at Space City JS</h1>
<p>I am super pumped to be presenting at Space City JS in Houston, Texas in March. Because travelling to speak at conferences often means I have to take leave from work I don&#39;t get to speak as often as I&#39;d like, but I really wanted to participate in Space City JS when I saw that Rails Girls, Girl Develop It and PyGirls HTX were involved -- hopefully that means there will be lots of women attending! </p>
<p>Normally I speak about Front End Design and animation topics but I will actually be talking about my journey in to dev ops while trying to improve our deployment processes at Active Theory.</p>
<p>If you are in Houston or nearby I really hope to see you there. <a href="http://spacecityjs.com/">http://spacecityjs.com</a></p>
