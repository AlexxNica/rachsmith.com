I'm Rachel, a late 20-something Australian living in Sunny California, USA.

My love affair with the web began when my dad first brought home a dial-up modem in '97 but I only started building it 5 years ago. I got my start making Flash banners for an advertising agency and have been obsessed with animation/motion on the web ever since. These days I find myself spending half of my dev time animating interfaces with CSS and JavaScript and the other half building APIs and backend applications with Node.js. I'm currently building all the websites for the awesome dudes over at <a href="http://activetheory.net">Active Theory</a>.

Even better than coding is spending time with my amazing husband, going to the beach, buying leopard print clothing and obsessing over eyebrow makeup.

If you are not a recruiter or a creep and would like to contact me, I'm pretty chatty over at <a href="http://twitter.com/rachsmithtweets">Twitter</a>, or you can send me an email at <a href="mailto:contact@rachsmith.com">contact@rachsmith.com</a>.
