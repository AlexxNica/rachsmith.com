<p>For the record, I am lucky enough to work in a workplace void of sexisim with a group of men that treat me like the intellegent human being that I am.</p>
<p>That hasn&#39;t always been my experience in the web/tech world though. The fact is, sexism and appalling behaviour is rife and for the most part, accepted as part and parcel of the industry. It is not just a problem for who so many people write off as &#39;angry feminists&#39;, it is a problem for all of us.</p>
<p>Some women I respect wrote an open letter on this issue. You should go read it &gt;&gt;&gt;
