# I'll be presenting at Space City JS

I am super pumped to be presenting at Space City JS in Houston, Texas in March. Because travelling to speak at conferences often means I have to take leave from work I don't get to speak as often as I'd like, but I really wanted to participate in Space City JS when I saw that Rails Girls, Girl Develop It and PyGirls HTX were involved -- hopefully that means there will be lots of women attending! 

Normally I speak about Front End Design and animation topics but I will actually be talking about my journey in to dev ops while trying to improve our deployment processes at Active Theory.

If you are in Houston or nearby I really hope to see you there. <a href="http://spacecityjs.com/">http://spacecityjs.com</a>
