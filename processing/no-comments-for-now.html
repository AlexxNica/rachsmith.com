<h1 id="no-comments-for-now">No comments for now</h1>
<p>Getting a new build of the site up, I was questioning whether to include Disqus comments in this version. I decided against it.</p>
<p>I decided against comments because my experience thus far with comments on my site have been more negative than positive. Too many people don&#39;t even read the post and then write an (often rude) comment about one thing, which I then have to delete (I refuse to let A-holes use my own site as a platform). As a result I found I was reluctant to post anything for fear of getting stupid comments, and my plan for this year was to write more.</p>
<p>Although it did result in some positive engagement with other people, I think I will leave comments off the blog for now, and encourage people to leave feedback via <a href="http://twitter.com/rachsmithtweets">Twitter</a> instead.</p>
